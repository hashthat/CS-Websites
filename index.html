This is a project that uses inline CSS And JavaScript.

The background photo was one of four that I generated through microsofts image creator. the Sentance was this:

"a creative palindrome with dreams in the stars who finds its way with a secret question "Rolling Stone". The person knows the destination through submitting their first and last name with their zip code because the secret question is a secret image that appears in a portal"

the body targets before the body element given the background image is displayed. It's fixed so the background does not scroll with the page. The top and LEft edges align with the web browsing display page where the image covers all of the background space 100% with the width and height. The image obviously does not repeat and the position is Centered. Sometimes there is a better position other than a centered image given the size. But the Opacity is part of the Transparency given the thought of the user and how visual the image might be on the website. */
