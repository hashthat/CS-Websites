the body targets before the body element given the background image is displayed. It's fixed so the background does not scroll with the page. The top and LEft edges align with the web browsing display page where the image covers all of the background space 100% with the width and height. The image obviously does not repeat and the position is Centered. Sometimes there is a better position other than a centered image given the size. But the Opacity is part of the Transparency given the thought of the user and how visual the image might be on the website.
